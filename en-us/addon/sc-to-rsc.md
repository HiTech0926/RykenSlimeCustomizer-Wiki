# Convert SC configuration to RSC configuration

Are you worried about rewriting the SC configuration you wrote previously because it cannot be converted to RSC?
Do you want a tool to automatically convert SC to RSC?

[balugaq](https://github.com/balugaq) developed the [SC-to-RSC](https://github.com/SlimefunReloadingProject/SC-to-RSC) tool (please read README.md for details),
which can solve the two problems you are worried about mentioned above.

SC-to-RSC also has advanced conversion options, including custom menus, additional parameters and other functions, which can help you generate personalized RSC.

He is also the author of [RSCchecker](https://github.com/SlimefunReloadingProject/RSCchecker) and [SCcheck](https://github.com/SlimefunReloadingProject/SCchecker) (only for the CN version) can also help determine whether your configuration is wrong.
