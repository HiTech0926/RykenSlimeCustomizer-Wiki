## Preface

I believe you have heard of a custom slime attachment SlimeCustomizer. But its limitations are too great. \
For this reason, we developed a custom slime attachment plug-in (RykenSlimeCustomizer), which is more customizable than SlimeCustomizer.

If you have learned languages such as Java and JavaScript, you can quickly get started writing more advanced machines.

## Introduction

First, you must be very curious about what is Ryken custom slime attachment (RykenSlimeCustomizer), and what is the difference between it and custom attachment (SlimeCustomizer)?

This page will explain the pros and cons of RykenSlimeCustomizer and SlimeCustomizer, and solve some of the most basic doubts about this plugin

## SlimeCustomizer and RykenSlimeCustomizer

To better show the difference between SlimeCustomizer and RykenSlimeCustomizer, we wrote another article, because RykenSlimeCustomizer has too many advantages!

[Differences between SlimeCustomizer and RykenSlimeCustomizer](plugin/comparison.md)

### SlimeCustomizer

[SlimeCustomizer](https://github.com/SlimefunGuguProject/SlimeCustomizer) is suitable for beginners. You donâ€™t need to learn Java and other languages. You can make basic accessories by modifying the most basic configuration.

SlimeCustomizer is easy to understand and simpler, but it has great limitations.
You can only customize in a **fixed framework**

For example, for machines, you can only arrange two inputs and two outputs,
and all machines have a unified format and menu

RykenSlimefunCustomizer accessories support more feature-rich machine customization and have very few limitations

The following page will explain RykenSlimefunCustomizer.

### RykenSlimeCustomizer

RykenSlimeCustomizer combines configuration with scripts (scripts are optional), greatly reducing the limitations of customization

You can customize any props you want through the script function attached to RykenSlimeCustomizer.

Script functions require the author to have a certain Java foundation,
but don't worry about it for authors without Java foundation

This wiki will list multiple script templates.
You can make slight modifications to the templates given in the wiki to implement custom props, advanced machines, etc.

## Special instructions

1. RykenSlimeCustomizer has the same **saveitem** function as SlimeCustomizer, so **saveitem** will not be described in detail in this wiki

2. RykenSlimeCustomizer and SlimeCustomizer do not conflict with each other and can coexist at the same time

3. RykenSlimeCustomizer is loaded after SlimeCustomizer, so you can directly reference the slime ID customized by SlimeCustomizer in RykenSlimeCustomizer
