## Overview

I believe you may have heard of SlimeCustomizer. But it has too many limitations.  
For this reason, we developed RykenSlimeCustomizer, which is more customizable than [SlimeCustomizer](https://github.com/NCBPFluffyBear/SlimeCustomizer).

If you have learned Java and JavaScript, you can quickly get started making more advanced machines using scripts.

## Introduction

## SlimeCustomizer and RykenSlimeCustomizer

[Differences between SlimeCustomizer and RykenSlimeCustomizer](/en-us/plugin/comparison.md)

### SlimeCustomizer

[SlimeCustomizer](https://github.com/NCBPFluffyBear/SlimeCustomizer) is suitable for beginners. You donâ€™t need to learn Java and other languages. You can make simple machines just by yaml configurations.

SlimeCustomizer is easy to understand, but it has many limitations.
You can only customize within the **given framework** of items.

For example, you can only have 2 input slots and 2 output slots in machines,
and all machines have the same layout.

RykenSlimefunCustomizer machines support more feature-rich machine customization and have very few limitations.

The following section will explain RykenSlimefunCustomizer.

### RykenSlimeCustomizer

RykenSlimeCustomizer combines configuration with optional scripts, allowing you to implement your ideas more flexibly.

You can customize any items you want through the scripts in RykenSlimeCustomizer.

Users are expected to have a certain foundation in Java and JavaScript to use scripts, but don't worry if you have 0 knowledge of Java and JavaScript.

This wiki contains multiple script templates.
You can make slight modifications to the templates given in the wiki to implement custom items, advanced machines, etc.

## Special instructions

1. RykenSlimeCustomizer has the same **saved item** feature as SlimeCustomizer, so **saved item** will not be described in detail in this wiki. Refer to [this section](https://github.com/NCBPFluffyBear/SlimeCustomizer#using-custom-items) if you don't know how to use **saved item**.

2. RykenSlimeCustomizer and SlimeCustomizer do not conflict with each other, you can install both at the same time.

3. RykenSlimeCustomizer is loaded after SlimeCustomizer, so you can directly reference the item IDs from SlimeCustomizer in RykenSlimeCustomizer.
